# Gamification with Unity 5.x
This is the code repository for [Gamification with Unity 5.x](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/gamification-unity-5x?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786463487), published by [Packt](https://packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Are you looking at implementing gamification techniques for your business and wondering where to get a complete rundown of all the tricks and techniques? Well, you have come to the right place!
## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter 3.



The code will look like the following:
```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
public class BrainstormingTool : MonoBehaviour {
```

Throughout the book we have used Unity 5.x to develop the gamified application. We have
also used Adobe Illustrator to complete some of the images. However, it is possible to use
any graphics creation program that you feel comfortable with using. In some instances,
word processing software is required to create documents, but feel free to use whatever you
prefer (for example, Microsoft Word, Adobe InDesign, Open Office). Other than that, the
only requirement from you is to bring your imagination and creativity.
